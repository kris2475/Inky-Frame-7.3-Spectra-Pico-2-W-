# Inky Frame 7.3" Spectra Pico 2 W - Complete Guide

## Executive Summary

This repository provides a complete end-to-end workflow for streaming images from a PC to the Inky Frame 7.3" Spectra display using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W. It includes all necessary steps: image preparation on a PC, serving the image over HTTP, configuring Wi-Fi credentials, and streaming/displaying the image on the Pico. This guide also references additional documents to provide detailed instructions and troubleshooting information.

## Introduction

The Inky Frame 7.3" Spectra is an 8-color e-paper display designed for rich, low-power image display. Using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W and specialized Pimoroni MicroPython firmware, users can stream images over Wi-Fi from their PC to the Inky Frame. This repository consolidates scripts, configuration, and documentation to simplify this process.

### Key Features
- Converts standard images (JPG, PNG) into 8-color raw format compatible with Inky Frame.
- Serves the image from a PC using a simple HTTP server.
- Connects the Pico 2 W to Wi-Fi and streams image data pixel-by-pixel.
- Includes troubleshooting and configuration guidance.
- Modular structure with separate scripts for clarity and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### 1. Hardware Setup
Refer to [`setup.md`](setup.md) for detailed hardware assembly and firmware installation instructions for the Pico 2 W and Inky Frame 7.3" Spectra.

### 2. Image Preparation
Use [`image_prep.py`](image_prep.py) to convert your source images into the raw format (`image_data.dat`) required by the display.

```python
prepare_image("your_image.png")
```

### 3. HTTP Server Setup
Host the raw image on your PC using a simple Python HTTP server. Follow [`HTTP_Server_Setup.md`](HTTP_Server_Setup.md) for step-by-step instructions, including firewall configuration and IP addressing.

### 4. Wi-Fi Credentials
Create a `secrets.py` file on the Pico W with your Wi-Fi SSID and password. Instructions are provided in [`HTTP_Server_Setup.md`](HTTP_Server_Setup.md).

### 5. Pico Execution
Upload `boot.py` and `image_display.py` to the root of your Pico W using Thonny. `boot.py` will automatically run the display script on startup.

### 6. Troubleshooting
For common issues with Wi-Fi connectivity, server access, or display refresh, refer to [`Troubleshooting.md`](Troubleshooting.md).

## Notes and Recommendations
- Ensure the Pico W has sufficient power (use a wall adapter, not a computer USB port).
- Keep the HTTP server terminal open during image streaming.
- Use the recommended folder and repository structure to avoid path issues.
- Keep `secrets.py` private and out of version control.
